      <description>More about me &amp;hellip; I have two Master&amp;rsquo;s degrees in linguistics, one from UCLA where I had started a PhD and the other from North Carolina State University. I studied laboratory phonology, sociophonetics, and statistical research methods.
I&amp;rsquo;m originally from Minnesota, but I&amp;rsquo;ve lived in Wisconsin, France, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, California (twice!), and now Toronto, Ontario in Canada.
My favorite things are: watching horror and scifi movies, being outdoors and exercising, discovering new places to eat, going to shows (music and comedy) and struggling to decide what I want to learn next.</description>
