    <div class="content">
      <p>This week I asked for feedback on something I wrote from a trusted colleague. My audience was larger than usual for me and 100% men (as far as I knew). Although I&rsquo;m already pretty confident in my prose-writing skills, I felt greater than usual pressure to make a compelling, tight story. I wanted what I wrote to sound authoritative and well informed.</p>
<p>My colleague gave me great constructive feedback and overall really liked what I wrote. Except one spot where I came across as harsh and somewhat arrogant.</p>
<p>I cringed. <em>I know, I know</em>. When drafting that particular point, I had literally thought to myself (knowing that I can tend to hedge too much) &ldquo;Okay, try to sound very assertive and <em>masculine</em>.&rdquo; It wasn&rsquo;t me. It wasn&rsquo;t my style or my voice. And it ended up sounding too abrasive.</p>
<p>Anyway, easy enough fix. I softened the language and sent it off to my co-authors.</p>
<p>But, I kept thinking about this. It really made me realize how I&rsquo;m constantly monitoring how I speak and write to perfectly balance cold authority and warm personability. Whether I&rsquo;m self conscious about the number of &ldquo;:)&rdquo; or &ldquo;!&rdquo; that I use in an email or my willingness to admit &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo; in a meeting, it&rsquo;s a perpetual struggle against my natural tendencies.</p>
<p>The thing is, I rarely actually feel 100% confident. But I know that my male counterparts, even when they <em>sound</em> totally (and sometimes absurdly) sure of themselves, they can&rsquo;t possibly be so certain either! So I try to put myself in their state of mind and just fake it. If I don&rsquo;t &ldquo;sound technical enough&rdquo;, I&rsquo;d rather actually become more competent than merely sound like it, for example. That&rsquo;s where my energy goes.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really like games, either, where I have to put on a guise and deceive my audience. And obviously it can be backfire coming from a woman. A woman product manager without a background in software engineering. But I don&rsquo;t have patience for that and I prefer to be my honest, authentic self.</p>
<p>So after dwelling on this for a couple of days, I think I&rsquo;ve come up with a way to determine how to strike the right tone. I&rsquo;ll rehearse for my husband. I&rsquo;m 100% comfortable and safe saying what I truthfully believe in a confident way to him. We&rsquo;ll see how this strategy works for me the next time I&rsquo;m stuck on how to phrase something in an authoritative way that still sounds like me.</p>
<p>Anyway, this isn&rsquo;t really a theory informed blog post. It could be if I spent some minutes doing some research on gendered language in the workplace and maybe I&rsquo;ll do that later. Even though as a linguist I feel a bit guilty about that, for now I wanted the gratification of finally publishing a new blog post after a few months.</p>
<p>How do you decide how &ldquo;aggressive&rdquo; to be at work?</p>
