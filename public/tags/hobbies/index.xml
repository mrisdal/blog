      <description>My Year in Review, 2021 Welcome to my third annual Meg‚Äôs year-in-review post (see 2020 and 2019) and what‚Äôs my first blog post in all of 2021. Eek. Haven‚Äôt made much time for writing, unfortunately; it‚Äôs been a much busier, happier year than 2020 was! Unlike 2020 which I spent in a monotonous, depressing ‚Äúcomfort zone‚Äù (the pandemic obviously didn‚Äôt help), this year I really took back control of my happiness.</description>

      <description>This is my second year-in-review post see my 2019 post. This year was much shittier than last year. That&amp;rsquo;s partly my fault and partly the fault of the pandemic, my bike getting stolen, etc. etc. So I think I spent most of this year in a &amp;ldquo;comfort zone&amp;rdquo; which was somewhat depressing and monotonous. There were some bright spots, though:
I started my new (old) job back at Kaggle which has been good My husband and I took a lovely vacation to Hawaii right before the pandemic hit I started cooking a lot more and haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten totally sick of it yet I began doing something like mentoring semi-regularly I&amp;rsquo;ve improved a lot at disconnecting from work I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to socialize occasionally through things like horror movie club, playing Among Us, etc.</description>

      <title>New Hobbies</title>

      <description>A couple of weeks ago I tweeted that I wanted to explore new hobbies. For the past couple of years, I&amp;rsquo;ve engrossed myself in a job I love. My career development has been really rewarding professionally, but lately I&amp;rsquo;ve felt personally underdeveloped. My current hobbies include seeing movies (especially horror and sci-fi) and exploring my new home of Los Angeles (biking, hiking, and of course eating). While these things are fun, I feel like I could be doing and creating so much more.</description>
