      <title>Product management lessons learned through King Crimson lyrics</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Almost every musician I listen to carries influences of the progressive rock band King Crimson. For instance, my favorite musician Steven Wilson has put out entire albums that (to me) sounds like a King Crimson ‚Äúproject‚Äù. Including his debut solo album &lt;em&gt;Grace for Drowning&lt;/em&gt; which featured several King Crimson members including Tony Levin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I realized not only does King Crimson&amp;rsquo;s sound echo prodigiously within the discographies of my favorite artists, they&amp;rsquo;ve also had a thing or two to say about good (and bad) product management over the decades!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without further ado, I present: product management lessons learned through King Crimson lyrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;epitaph&#34;&gt;Epitaph&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/-C-HytsGYg0&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowledge is a deadly friend&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If no one sets the rules&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fate of all mankind, I see&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is in the hands of fools&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great power comes from great responsibility and your team looks to you to set the rules. If they sense they‚Äôre in the hands of fools, well, confusion will be their epitaph ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs important to set a strong vision and get buy-in!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;three-of-a-perfect-pair&#34;&gt;Three of a Perfect Pair&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/kKkGMA5gcC0&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She is susceptible&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is impossible&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have their cross to share&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three of a perfect pair&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has his contradicting views&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She has her cyclothymic moods&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They make a study in despair&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three of a perfect pair&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This song is clearly about channeling healthy conflict within ‚ÄúThe Triad‚Äù: engineering, design, and PM. If things get complicated, aggravated, you‚Äôll end up with a perfect mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;starless&#34;&gt;Starless&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/FhKJgqxNDD8&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sundown dazzling day&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold through my eyes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But my eyes turned within&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only see&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starless and bible black&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there‚Äôs any reason why product managers exist, it‚Äôs to set a direction and chart a path for their team to get there. Without a north star, your smiles will only signal emptiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;frame-by-frame&#34;&gt;Frame by Frame&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/OxfSC9GybPA&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frame by frame (Suddenly)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Death by drowning (from within)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In your, in your analysis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Product managers are constantly making and facilitating decisions. Speed and quality count. Breaking things down step by step can help ensure you don‚Äôt fall prey to analysis paralysis so you can keep your team unblocked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dinosaur&#34;&gt;Dinosaur&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZyBqpjcissc&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ignorance has alway been something I excel in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Followed by naivety and pride&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doesn&amp;rsquo;t take a scientist to see how&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any clever predator could have a piece of me&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike the fossil in these lyrics, a product manager should reflect and learn from their mistakes. For that matter, a good product manager is &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; eager to learn and innovate. Otherwise someone will be digging your bones, too ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reply&#34;&gt;Reply&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow the conversation and discuss on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Have you wanted to learn some product management lessons via King Crimson lyrics?

      <title>How our team improved perceived reliability of Kaggle Notebooks</title>
      <link>https://www.meg.dev/posts/improved-kaggle-notebooks-reliability/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 13 Aug 2020 15:18:44 -0700</pubDate>
      <author>hello@meg.dev (Meg Risdal)</author>
      <guid>https://www.meg.dev/posts/improved-kaggle-notebooks-reliability/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve worked at Kaggle on-and-off since 2016. In this time, THE most consistent source of user feedback is about the reliability of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kaggle.com/notebooks&#34;&gt;Kaggle Notebooks&lt;/a&gt;. Sessions were slow to start and, far worse, sometimes users would lose hours of work. While progress had been made over the years, we‚Äôd never systematically addressed the problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past half year or so since I‚Äôve rejoined Kaggle, the Notebooks team renewed its focus on reliability. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;m proud to share how our team used a systematic approach to significantly improve reliability, both in terms of quantitative metrics as well as user perceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kaggle Notebooks is a no-cost managed &lt;a href=&#34;https://jupyter.org/&#34;&gt;Jupyter-based&lt;/a&gt; notebook product. Our users use Python and R notebooks to analyze datasets, train models, and submit predictions to machine learning competitions. Today we manage many thousands of VMs handling thousands of concurrent sessions for users all around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I joined in 2020, we felt confident that reliability was the number one thing we could work on to improve our users‚Äô experience using Kaggle Notebooks. We knew this from:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&#34;https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/43221.pdf&#34;&gt;happiness and tracking survey&lt;/a&gt; we send to a sample of users each month&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The volume of bug reports on our &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kaggle.com/product-feedback&#34;&gt;site feedback forums&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improving user experience is a critical priority for Kaggle for a few reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notebook usage is required for some competitions and we don‚Äôt want the user experience to be such a pain that it turns users off participating completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many brand new data science learners use Notebooks and if you‚Äôre new to something, sometimes it‚Äôs hard to tell if bugs and instability are your fault or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want users to use Kaggle Notebooks enough to create cool, helpful analyses that they want to share with the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;our-approach&#34;&gt;Our approach&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our approach to the problem, we considered reliability as having two facets: actual and perceived. In the first half of 2020, we prioritized a number of focused improvements to address both facets:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We maintained a dedicated working group to address a backlog of issues and monitor and respond to user feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We implemented a new scalable, highly available backend architecture (&lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/google-cloud/a-multi-cluster-grpc-architecture-on-gke-365bbd757df&#34;&gt;read about it from Mod&lt;/a&gt;, the technical lead on the project) with multiregion support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We shipped features to improve perceived reliability like ‚Äúsessionless editing‚Äù, a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kaggle.com/product-feedback/139884&#34;&gt;brand new save workflow&lt;/a&gt;, and better session start/stop controls in the UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We feel the biggest game-changer was the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kaggle.com/product-feedback/152669&#34;&gt;sessionless editing&lt;/a&gt; feature that we delivered in June. Previously, rendering the notebook required a running jupyter server. But, starting the session took over a minute at the 95th percentile and about half a minute at the 50th percentile. This was a huge point of frustration for our users that we hypothesized contributed substantially to perceptions of poor reliability. With sessionless editing, we can now render and initialize the notebook editor within seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gif below illustrates a side-by-side comparison of the experience before and after launching our sessionless editing feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/M4JW0ArB84eEPsvv5QPvSfj5mgmiyGShz2Z7G864Xtew7KWHGc-U9-FPlLdPwHDGOsVknZie7SOfDhdJcjbHr79XeaeLgXeRKoz1GmusJ-0XHSDW8vv9MlvCt7gfulhi4sMmJjASOA&#34;&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;_Less waiting, more coding._&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, measuring impact was critical. To match actual and perceived reliability, we took a multi-modal approach to quantifying the results of our efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To measure actual reliability, our reliability working group created a dashboard to monitor and set goals against some key metrics like availability and time-to-edit latency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In part to measure perceived reliability on an ongoing basis, we also started a quarterly one-question survey. It asks recent notebooks users to ‚ÄúPlease select any of the issues below that you have experienced on Kaggle Notebooks in the past couple of months‚Äù. Users could then select multiple options like ‚ÄúNotebook session was unreliable‚Äù and ‚ÄúInsufficient features available‚Äù. We fielded the survey twice: once at the end of Q1 and again at the end of Q2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;results&#34;&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôll focus on the qualitative results in response to the one-question reliability survey. Our quantitative data showed progress, but would require a longer blog post to walk through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, you can see the overall results below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ZFxsZkuPKlMNm64NdbU8Wf07xhdO3TLfSsKdatZqk_zkjxwo48W6-FKLHLKu3h_amLMHC0Y9AeWnzQn1P4vEaSxcNF_kHPgER34N6e-8o4h1yyKeSn1mLCS3PEnuSry7HZcD4eG0yw&#34;&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;_Overall issues that survey respondents said they experience using Kaggle Notebooks._&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most users in both quarters reported having no recent issues which is great. But, reliability (i.e., ‚ÄúNotebook session was unreliable‚Äù) was the second most common response in both quarters. Reliability concerns definitely still persist among respondents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we focus on percentage change between Q1 and Q2, however, it becomes clear that we did successfully make progress in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/FSuAei-kyBuW76fb9v0V8va91RgmFGfIB98cFD_St4iWTPfx1GC7qBQfzFh0G26i2OKKBm5L9shfD3Wlagjgn2jO8TbTrQSOJYdHovEAxvG1BqYLRmI_EJsEMHujFHdhy4ahtyPGyA&#34;&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;_Percentage change from quarter-to-quarter for each issue._&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because most of these items are issues (i.e., pain points), an increase from Q1 to Q2 is generally bad (red) whereas a decrease is generally good (blue). Only some of the changes are actually significant (the solid-filled bars).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We saw statistically significant decreases in users mentioning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;üìâ 33%: Can&amp;rsquo;t depend on notebooks to do serious work&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;üìâ 19%: Session was unreliable&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;üìâ 18%: Session was slow&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though reliability still remains a top concern for our users, we were really pleased with these results. Plus, this is the first time we‚Äôve quantified user perceptions to tell us that we‚Äôre making progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;takeaways&#34;&gt;Takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest takeaway is that we‚Äôre not done yet, but we‚Äôre trending in the right direction. We remind ourselves regularly that this is a journey and what matters is being on the right track. Based on our results so far, we intend to maintain our dedicated reliability working group, set new goals, and continue to listen to user feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Massive thanks to everyone on the team who contributed to this effort: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kaggle.com/aagundez&#34;&gt;Aurelio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kaggle.com/jplotts&#34;&gt;Jim&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kaggle.com/herbison&#34;&gt;Dustin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kaggle.com/noderaider&#34;&gt;Cole&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kaggle.com/gphilmod&#34;&gt;Philippe (Mod)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kaggle.com/mbooth&#34;&gt;Michael&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kaggle.com/rosebv&#34;&gt;Vincent&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kaggle.com/erdalsivri&#34;&gt;Erdal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kaggle.com/einavcb&#34;&gt;Einav&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kaggle.com/craerek&#34;&gt;Chelsea&lt;/a&gt;. It‚Äôs an honor and a thrill to be part of such a great team.  Special thanks to Jim who co-authored the original internal report that this blog post is based on and to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530&#34;&gt;Jessica&lt;/a&gt; for fielding the survey.

      <title>Reflections on Stack Overflow: Building Successful Communities</title>
      <link>https://www.meg.dev/posts/reflections-on-stack-overflow/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 06 Dec 2019 00:48:59 -0500</pubDate>
      <author>hello@meg.dev (Meg Risdal)</author>
      <guid>https://www.meg.dev/posts/reflections-on-stack-overflow/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today is my last day at Stack Overflow. For most of this year, I was the lead product manager for their flagship product, public Q&amp;amp;A. In my last couple of weeks there, I spent some time reflecting on what I have learned and how my perspectives as a product leader matured. As someone deeply invested in building open developer communities, I continue to refine my opinions about how to approach building community-facing products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on these reflections, the following is my own personal perspective on what a product leader at a place like Stack Overflow can do to be successful (and hence make community products successful). Although they are pretty specific to Stack Overflow, I am taking what I‚Äôve learned with me to my next endeavor and you may find them applicable to your world, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make Stack Overflow work for &lt;strong&gt;everyone&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be ambitious and a driver of positive change in the face of inertia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The community is an asset. Experiment, iterate, and listen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create simple defaults and tear down configuration and customization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep the mission and impact in perspective always.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;building-a-successful-community&#34;&gt;Building a successful community&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;make-stack-overflow-work-for-everyone-do-not-indulge-us-versus-them-dynamics&#34;&gt;Make Stack Overflow work for everyone. Do not indulge ‚Äúus versus them‚Äù dynamics.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many types of people who use Stack Overflow. The main segments for Public Q&amp;amp;A are: Askers (including people who just look up answers to existing questions), Answerers, Curators, and Moderators. The interesting thing about Stack Overflow‚Äôs user base though is that all of these segments (of real people!) interact with each other in feedback loops:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People ask questions and other people answer those questions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curators identify quality issues and other people receive that feedback&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People flag content that doesn‚Äôt belong on the site and moderators handle those flags&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any initiatives that only serve one segment put the community and product into imbalance. In reality you‚Äôre making changes in a complex, dynamical system of real people in a community. Emphasizing one type of user also makes things unnecessarily personal. By ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù I mean about people, not about the system/software. I observed that this triggers an ‚Äúus versus them‚Äù backlash which is not necessary and causes users to suffer. Instead, focus on the system itself and how all different kinds of users participate in it to interact with each other. I believe that this is an approach that will inherently make Stack Overflow more welcoming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/dUf-m_ircDT_3QXoWEnrVqZqv6FFPSvBHz8UOmSYKT8l2S_R4SQQaaXK35XJKpa9cK1CLM_XCq7Stet6M2Xktq17Id94uK88sZs282LvXhJ2L0pJlBxEjApSujLK8QSzw6YUXZZZ&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some things I kept in mind when thinking about how to make Stack Overflow work for everyone:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Always ask ‚ÄúHow does this impact users?‚Äù&lt;/em&gt;. In specs/briefs I write, I always explicitly consider all participants in the relevant feedback loop. Going through this motion can uncover unanswered questions, highlights your thought process for readers, develops a muscle for user-focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Treat everyone as a valuable person as part of the system&lt;/em&gt;. Even if I‚Äôm working on something mainly designed to help one type of user, it can go a LONG ways both internally and externally to demonstrate care for everyone. Other people will pick sides or favorites, but you as the chief advocate for your users cannot succumb to this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Think holistically&lt;/em&gt;. I tend to like to think of user journeys in product work. For a given feature, how did users arrive there? What‚Äôs the next step? Considering all participants at each touchpoint in a user journey is a natural extension of this thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;be-ambitious-and-a-driver-of-positive-change-in-the-face-of-inertia-exude-optimism&#34;&gt;Be ambitious and a driver of positive change in the face of inertia. Exude optimism.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team focused on public Q&amp;amp;A is shockingly small: four IC developers. And the surface area of responsibility is enormous: all of Stack Overflow and the Stack Exchange network serving millions of people every month. Stack Overflow is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.alexa.com/topsites&#34;&gt;top 50 site in Alexa rankings&lt;/a&gt;. Having the impact the user base needs and deserves requires efficient use of resources paired with a healthy openness to risk. Otherwise it‚Äôs too easy to slip into conservative bug-fixing mode to just keep the status quo afloat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that the team is super capable when pushed to dream big. When I joined in early 2019, we made 7 internal commitments of which only 28% were hit. In October, we made 31 internal commitments and hit an 84% completion. This was possible despite receiving no additional developer resources during this timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some tips for keeping functional teams productive and engaged:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Constantly clarify ambiguities&lt;/em&gt;. The biggest thing a product manager can do to help team productivity is clarify ambiguities. In the face of chaos or shifting priorities, the best thing you can do is make sure to shield the team as much as possible so they can stay focused on productive project work. In the day to day, stay engaged with what they‚Äôre working on and answer their questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Accentuate the positive&lt;/em&gt;. This team has historically been subjected to a lot of strife. Be empathetic, but do your best to sincerely highlight successes and positive motivators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Connect the team with end users&lt;/em&gt;. Making the team clearly see how their work has impact is a morale boost and motivator. Some ways to do this include inviting developers to join user interviews, reviewing and discussing research with a broad group of people, and holding project retrospectives that include preliminary data on feature performance. In a small example, I always included a user quote in the team‚Äôs weekly company-wide report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-community-is-an-asset-experiment-iterate-and-listen-to-your-users-the-whole-time&#34;&gt;The community is an asset. Experiment, iterate, and listen to your users the whole time.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rapid experimentation, incremental releases, and iteration is an opportunity to keep a dialogue with your users open. It‚Äôs a venue for you to not only involve them in the conversation, but to shape it by sharing and aligning on goals. Like I once told a coworker, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre both on different vectors. I share mine with you and you share yours with me and we both get a little closer and amplify our efforts.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of examples of this approach took place as part of our bigger efforts to improve experiences related to question closing. In one recent project, we worked to &lt;a href=&#34;https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/337013/new-post-notices-rollout-on-stack-overflow&#34;&gt;ship the new post notices feature early&lt;/a&gt; and we were responsive to feedback from users. This led to making lots of small improvements before &lt;a href=&#34;https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/339700/new-post-notices-are-live-network-wide&#34;&gt;rolling the change out more broadly&lt;/a&gt;. In another example, we &lt;a href=&#34;https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/388313/experiment-ended-closing-and-reopening-happens-at-3-votes-for-the-next-30-day&#34;&gt;engaged the community closely&lt;/a&gt; in testing different thresholds for voting to close and reopen questions, including &lt;a href=&#34;https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/390083/threshold-experiment-results-closing-editing-and-reopening-all-become-more-eff&#34;&gt;transparently sharing&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.to/stackoverflow/experiment-results-testing-close-reopen-thresholds-on-stack-overflow-5a35&#34;&gt;results of our experiments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/MAKHGYl_QDfLybaA-x6I5adBck2kCXvchwVJqWv319TBIrb9hibjlDOjO7aZ8s9UrKfsHWISpE10udrKDKQ2QQyBl20bv683P5neVj4umt5zpere-0uWfvqa8ljT9jJzOKAE1zK4&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stack Overflow is a website with a huge user base. Not taking advantage of the ability to run tests and get feedback from enthusiastic community members is a missed opportunity. Do it in complement with other research methods. At the same time, these feedback loops threaten to slow things down and can be emotionally draining. Your mileage may vary (and a lot seems to depend on individual tastes), but here are some quick tips:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don‚Äôt take things personally&lt;/em&gt;. You‚Äôll get a lot of critique, positive and negative. As a product manager you have to emotionally separate yourself from the features you work on as much as possible. Instead, invest your energy into focusing on the objectives you share with end users and other stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Delegate communication&lt;/em&gt;. It can be exhausting and extremely time consuming to interact deeply with a critical audience. Lean on people who are experts at this. For example, you can try strategies like ghostwriting blog posts or asking others to synthesize feedback for you in a report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Take a principled stance&lt;/em&gt;. Decision-making is easier when you already have clear objectives and guiding product principles to use as heuristics. So form these early and lean on them aggressively to quickly resolve feedback rather than debating minutiae at length.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where appropriate, experimenting and iterating on ideas in public is also a great way to battle harden new features before introducing them to Teams customers, &lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/teams&#34;&gt;Stack Overflow‚Äôs Private Q&amp;amp;A product&lt;/a&gt;. If something is successful at Stack Overflow‚Äôs scale, it may work for a company‚Äôs internal knowledge management, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;create-simple-defaults-and-tear-down-configuration-and-customization-do-not-try-to-please-everyone&#34;&gt;Create simple defaults and tear down configuration and customization. Do not try to please everyone.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stack Overflow is too complex. It‚Äôs hard to use for people who are not power users, it‚Äôs difficult to maintain for engineers, and it‚Äôs a challenge to design and build changes that work around tons of variants. This is not sustainable for such a small team with a huge mandate. For example, take &lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/users/8157789/megan-risdal?tab=profile&#34;&gt;user profiles&lt;/a&gt;. They‚Äôre a mess of information overload, they‚Äôre bogged down with tons of settings and togglable preferences (some only used by a tiny number of people), and users can maintain unique profiles for each and every network site that they‚Äôre a member of. Then there‚Äôs the overall network profile. And chat profiles. Then profiles for Teams (private Q&amp;amp;A), too. Oh, and they‚Äôre not mobile responsive. Yuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/MIAbOqg_Uccnlufi4Ubuos2FTc1fCe-1r1ZF2XUHu3eknZnGiN_Xg6B5WJMkp8RW54ILnF1V0WveZJgiNlVDXrWKnE-bPUnmvomfIUwzoNoiQXk0Kh3rlb7QGUfgjL8K9YB2Nizw&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking things away by simplifying them will be hard, but it‚Äôs necessary for the future of Stack Overflow. When I first joined Stack Overflow in March, the team launched the new &lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/08/22/impact-of-ask-question-wizard/&#34;&gt;Ask Question Wizard&lt;/a&gt;. This created a whole new default question-asking flow for users with less than 111 reputation while other users had the old (10 years old) form intact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UX of the wizard was clunky. We heard this in feedback from a random sample of people who responded to our new monthly site satisfaction survey. And maintaining it AND the existing form was an immediate timesuck as we battled bugs and strange edge cases arising from technical workarounds required to support this complex feature. It wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if its measurable benefits actually stemmed from how hard it was to use. Therefore, we went back to the drawing board, taking what we learned from the wizard &lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/09/26/research-update-improving-the-question-asking-experience/&#34;&gt;plus additional research&lt;/a&gt;, and launched a redesign of the question-asking form for everyone. The data (&lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/11/12/research-update-a-b-testing-the-new-question-form/&#34;&gt;quantitative&lt;/a&gt; and qualitative) and increased simplicity led us to consider it a huge improvement. Plus, it‚Äôs now way easier to iterate on (since of course it‚Äôs still not perfect!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do more to reduce forking paths and little used customizations. It‚Äôs not realistic to continue supporting these given extremely constrained resources and minimal benefit to users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThis web of time ‚Äì the strands of which approach one another, bifurcate, intersect or ignore each other through the centuries ‚Äì embraces every possibility. We do not exist in most of them. In some you exist and not I, while in others I do, and you do not.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äï Jorge Luis Borges, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/14566729&#34;&gt;The Garden of Forking Paths&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some tips for approaching this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Make data-driven decisions&lt;/em&gt;. Use data (quantitative and qualitative) at every level to inform how you solve this problem. Use data to prioritize which things to tackle first and then use data to decide what configurations are most important, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Involve all stakeholders in decision-making&lt;/em&gt;. You really, really have to know who is dependent on something and how when you‚Äôre planning to take it away. Make sure to involve the right people in the conversation and, as much as possible, share the same data you have access to (and invite them to ask new questions, too).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Have empathy&lt;/em&gt;. Loss aversion is a very real thing. Even if simplifying something is the best thing for users by all other accounts, taking something away still hurts. And this impacts not just end users, but the people who originally worked on a feature. You can have empathy by understanding how they use the feature and asking about the historical context around its original creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;keep-the-mission-and-impact-in-perspective-always&#34;&gt;Keep the mission and impact in perspective always.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With respect to mission, a lot of people are passionate about Stack Overflow and its community. There are a lot of loud voices and strong opinions pulling in many directions. Do what you can to keep focus on the bigger picture, both inside the team and externally. In this period of transition for the company, the mission is still being honed, but here are some things I personally believe to be important:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stack Overflow is a source of high quality question and answer pairs&lt;/strong&gt;. Do things that continue to grow this content, enrich it, and make it easier to access and use for all developers. But, Stack Overflow is not equivalent to Wikipedia. It‚Äôs not made up of facts frozen in time. More than a traditional encyclopedia, relevant information and practices in Stack Overflow‚Äôs community change as the developer landscape evolves. Make Stack Overflow a living, evolving library. It will never be ‚Äúdone‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make Stack Overflow for all developers&lt;/strong&gt;. It started as a place to serve programming enthusiasts and this was a successful way to catalyze the creation of a community and corpus of technical knowledge. Over time, it has clearly shown potential to make lives better for anyone who writes code. Figure out how to make Stack Overflow a place where anyone in the world who codes has a place to participate and learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With respect to impact, this is where it‚Äôs all too easy to fall into a trap of listening only to a small minority of people who enthusiastically offer their voices. These voices are super important to be sure, but they need to be balanced. In my time at Stack Overflow, we put a lot of effort into filling gaps in who we listened to. The vast majority of people who use Stack Overflow don‚Äôt have accounts (or aren‚Äôt logged-in) yet we had virtually no way to hear from them until we launched a &lt;a href=&#34;https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/43221.pdf&#34;&gt;satisfaction tracking survey&lt;/a&gt; last summer. At the same time, we also strengthened ties between Community Management and product as a way to more scalably incorporate feedback from highly engaged users into the work we prioritized. They need to have a seat at the table in all of major feature work in order to continue to have a big impact on the solutions the team designs. They are experts on different types of user segments as well as the system and are critical to building Stack Overflow to better serve everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continue keeping impact in perspective and strive to better serve the needs of all types of users. It‚Äôs difficult, painful work because limited resources means important people may feel ignored. But I have confidence that progress will continue to be made on this front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-conclusion&#34;&gt;In conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These beliefs are a reflection of my own personal values as a growing product leader who‚Äôs passionate about building great experiences for global developer communities, and as someone who has a great deal of optimism about the future of Stack Overflow. If I had to sum them up, I‚Äôd say I believe in unrelenting user focus and optimizing for global, rather than local, minima. I‚Äôm excited to take these values, along with everything I learned at Stack Overflow, with me in my next adventure: rejoining the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kaggle.com/&#34;&gt;Kaggle&lt;/a&gt; team at Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thank you to Shog9, Donna Choi, and Julia Silge for their feedback on drafts of this post.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My Interview with Superlinguo: Linguists in Careers</title>
      <link>https://www.meg.dev/posts/superlinguo-interview/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 06 Dec 2019 00:29:18 -0500</pubDate>
      <author>hello@meg.dev (Meg Risdal)</author>
      <guid>https://www.meg.dev/posts/superlinguo-interview/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.superlinguo.com/post/188176778397/linguistics-jobs-interview-with-a-product-manager&#34;&gt;cross-posted from an interview I recently did with Superlinguo&lt;/a&gt;, a language and linguistics blog by Lauren Gawne, for her excellent linguists in careers series.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Lauren:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of tech people I know say ‚Äúthe best skill a programmer can have is knowing how to look up the right answer on Stack Exchange‚Äù It‚Äôs one of those websites that people use every day, but perhaps without thinking about how it gets built. Megan Risdal is one of the people who make Stack Overflow happen, as a Product Manager leading Public Q&amp;amp;A. As Megan mentions below, there‚Äôs even a &lt;a href=&#34;https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/&#34;&gt;Linguistics Stack Exchange&lt;/a&gt; (you might just see some old &lt;a href=&#34;https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/users/64/laureng&#34;&gt;answers from me&lt;/a&gt; there). Megan has not only forged a career for herself in tech, she helps demystify the industry for other linguists who might follow in her footsteps, on Twitter (@MeganRisdal) and her &lt;a href=&#34;meg.dev&#34;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://66.media.tumblr.com/05270b919fb9c719ff5cd491b37cbc67/16001c6a0b1b48e1-83/s500x750/b18e006454ce10d5d11c582767ff40371240094d.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-did-you-study-at-university&#34;&gt;What did you study at university?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My undergraduate degree is in Psychology from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.uwec.edu/&#34;&gt;University of Wisconsin, Eau Claire&lt;/a&gt; where my interests were in &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_psychology&#34;&gt;individual differences&lt;/a&gt;. I also did a minor in French and this is where I first learned about linguistics as a field of study. My combined interests in language and individual differences psychology led me to completing a senior thesis project on variation in attitudes towards linguistic diversity. Just last year this work was published with my then advisor, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.uwec.edu/profiles/bensonej/&#34;&gt;Dr. Erica Benson&lt;/a&gt;, as a chapter in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/languages-linguistics/sociolinguistics/language-regard-methods-variation-and-change?format=HB&#34;&gt;Language Regard: Methods, Variation, and Change&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here, I did a Master‚Äôs degree in Sociolinguistics at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ncsu.edu/&#34;&gt;North Carolina State University&lt;/a&gt;. Building on my statistics background from studying psychology, I dove deeper into quantitative methods, learning R along the way, while focusing on sociophonetics and laboratory phonology. For my capstone project, I measured articulatory (ultrasound tongue imaging), aerodynamic, (nasal/oral airflow), and acoustic variation in coarticulatory vowel nasalization strategies among Anglo-American and African American (Vernacular) English speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I started a PhD at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ucla.edu/&#34;&gt;UCLA&lt;/a&gt; where I intended to continue studying laboratory phonology. I only ended up finishing one year which was spent on theoretical foundations, articulatory phonetics, and learnability before leaving with a second Master‚Äôs degree in Linguistics. I ended up deciding to leave academia because I was disillusioned already with the prospect of the job market and the limited potential for my work to have impact beyond academia. I made my mind up when I applied for a job at Google and got an interview. I ultimately failed, but this was enough for me to feel confident my resume was ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù (completely incidentally I ended up later getting hired and working at Google for a couple of years prior to my current role).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-your-job&#34;&gt;What is your job?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past six months I‚Äôve been working as a Product Manager at &lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/&#34;&gt;Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt; where I lead the team working on public Q&amp;amp;A. If you‚Äôre not familiar with Stack Overflow, it‚Äôs a site where anyone who codes can come to find answers to their programming questions. We also have the Stack Exchange network which has similar Q&amp;amp;A sites for other topics like cooking and anime. There‚Äôs even a &lt;a href=&#34;https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/&#34;&gt;Linguistics Stack Exchange&lt;/a&gt; site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my day-to-day, as a product manager, I work closely with our developers, designers, researchers, data scientists, community managers, marketing, and leadership. So, it‚Äôs a lot of meetings and a lot of Google Docs. My job entails taking many, many inputs and synthesizing them into a strategy and product roadmap that the team executes on to make Stack Overflow a more useful, engaging place for all developers. On a given day, you could catch me writing a new feature specification for a developer, reviewing results of an experiment with our data scientists, or dropping in on user interviews. One of the things I love the most about my job is the variety. If a project is slipping or we just don‚Äôt have the resources for something important, I‚Äôm the person who can step in and do what it takes to make sure the work of my collaborators adds up to something successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-does-your-linguistics-training-help-you-in-your-job&#34;&gt;How does your linguistics training help you in your job?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My training in linguistics absolutely helps me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, and most importantly I believe, my background in sociolinguistics has taught me the significance of diversity among groups of people (like users of a product) in so many ways. For example, Stack Overflow sees many millions of users every month, but we know that not everyone is equally likely to participate on the site. There are huge, intimidating barriers to participation which disproportionately impact different groups of people depending on things like their background and experience coding. So every day I think about how changes to the product will affect different types of users. Me and my team are constantly striving to better understand the important ways our users vary in their backgrounds, motivations, and pain points and how we can better meet their needs. Especially in a globally diverse online community like ours where users interact and community with each other it‚Äôs extremely important for me and my colleagues to think about always.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, and more concretely, the quantitative methods and experimental best practices I acquired while studying linguistics are highly applicable to my day-to-day job. We make use of a lot of different qualitative and quantitative research methods at Stack Overflow and having training in this area allows me to leverage these resources effectively in my product decision-making. Before I joined Stack Overflow, I had also spent some time as a data scientist, so my background in statistics and R was extremely relevant there. Without this training, I don‚Äôt think I would be where I am today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;do-you-have-any-advice-do-you-wish-someone-had-given-to-you-about-linguisticscareersuniversity&#34;&gt;Do you have any advice do you wish someone had given to you about linguistics/careers/university?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I‚Äôm very happy with my trajectory. I‚Äôm extremely grateful to everyone who supported me at every stage and I would not be where I am today without all of these experience (yes including dropping out of a PhD!). That said, some thing that I wish I had encountered sooner are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seriously, build a public portfolio. Make your work visible. Curate an online presence. Having even a just a modest &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/MeganRisdal&#34;&gt;Twitter following&lt;/a&gt; and some publicly discoverable content with my name on it has helped me immeasurably in my career. Oh, and learn git.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pay &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; attention to what‚Äôs going on outside of your academic bubble. I fully intended to stay in academia when I started my PhD at UCLA. Had I thought somewhat ahead of time about the possibility that I would end up industry, I may have prioritized different classes or perhaps even chosen a different PhD program altogether. For example, if you have a choice between learning OCaml and Python, maybe see what non-academia has to say, too, as an input to your decision. Then again, hindsight is 2020. I would have seriously regretted not taking statistics/research methods under any circumstances, though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;any-other-thoughts-or-comments&#34;&gt;Any other thoughts or comments?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think every tech company should look to hire people trained in linguistics. There are so, so many ways in which a background in linguistics is relevant to so many careers in tech. From user research to data science to (apparently) product management, a background in linguistics adds a unique and valuable perspective. If you‚Äôre not sure what you‚Äôre qualified for, carefully tailor your experience, cast your net wide, and seek out advice!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Know Nothing</title>
      <link>https://www.meg.dev/posts/how-to-know-nothing/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 12 May 2019 17:00:27 -0400</pubDate>
      <author>hello@meg.dev (Meg Risdal)</author>
      <guid>https://www.meg.dev/posts/how-to-know-nothing/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of months ago I started a new job as a product manager at Stack Overflow. This blog post is about how to know nothing in a new job. It&amp;rsquo;s about that whiplash-like experience of going from confidently knowing everything there is to know about your work to coming to a grinding to halt so you can start all over again from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://frinkiac.com/video/S09E19/TZFO4rsFaIkVsYcDt05xmH3LkhE=.gif&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, maybe it&amp;rsquo;s not so dramatic as that, but the insecure feelings I was having inspired me to ask for advice from my Twitter followers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Going from knowing everything and a half at one job to starting fresh is rough. Anyone have any tips for feeling better about it?&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; meg.ehh üá®üá¶ (@MeganRisdal) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/MeganRisdal/status/1120880418562002945?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;April 24, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give some more background, I was feeling especially daunted by my own lack of knowledge for a couple of reasons, I think:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kaggle.com/mrisdal&#34;&gt;Kaggle&lt;/a&gt; (my previous job) I worked through a really exciting high growth period. When I started in 2016, they were focused mainly on competitions and towards the end of my time there we had massively expanded the community, the product, and the team. We even lived through a successful acquisition by Google. I was present as a participant, either as a &amp;ldquo;witness&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;creator&amp;rdquo;, in all of this change. I felt that I could competently answer just about any question someone (internal or external) could ask me about Kaggle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the company I&amp;rsquo;ve joined (&lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/users/8157789/megan-risdal?tab=profile&#34;&gt;Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt;) is quite a bit like Kaggle in that it has a large, technical userbase with a rich history of cultural norms and past product decisions. That rich history has made Stack Overflow the household brand it is today, but it can feel intimidating as someone who wasn&amp;rsquo;t an active participant in it over the years. It&amp;rsquo;s a lot of tribal knowledge to catch up on!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, for this blog post I wanted to summarize some of the great advice I got from folks on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-its-normal-and-okay-to-feel-insecure&#34;&gt;1. It&amp;rsquo;s normal and okay to feel insecure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is worth mentioning up front! I got a number of replies from people either expressing solidarity or assuring me it&amp;rsquo;s a normal feeling for anyone starting a new job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Any time one starts a new job, it is completely normal to feel overwhelmed and insecure about your knowledge. Remember, starting out fresh is overwhelming for anyone. It&amp;#39;s completely normal for people to take 60-90 days to get up to speed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just remember you are kickass!&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; JSON Baumgartner (@jasonbaumgartne) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/jasonbaumgartne/status/1121099345535864842?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;April 24, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-remind-yourself-you-were-competent-and-you-will-be-again&#34;&gt;2. Remind yourself you were competent and you will be again&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is for those of us that laugh at the idea of ever succumbing to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect&#34;&gt;Dunning‚ÄìKruger effect&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to evaluating our own competence. I&amp;rsquo;ll admit that I requested my personnel file when leaving Google so I have my performance reviews to remind me that I &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; kick ass at my job in some objective-ish sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like this reply from someone else who recently changed teams:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;I mean j still feel hella dumb.. but I know I feel dumb because I&amp;#39;m learning new things. Which helps me realize I&amp;#39;m not really dumb. It&amp;#39;s just how I feel.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Fred v3.0.0 ü§ñüé∏ (@ProbNotABot) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ProbNotABot/status/1121188776250888192?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;April 24, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;3-lean-into-your-newbie-perspective-as-superpower&#34;&gt;3. Lean into your newbie perspective as superpower&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was probably my favorite reply (from a former colleague at Google):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;It helps when people remind me that being new to a company/role/tech area is a super power. You have fresh eyes, new perspectives, ideas for connections not yet made.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keep wearing those newbie cuffs of power as long as you can!&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; commandasaurus ü¶ñ (@amcasari) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/amcasari/status/1120881183552757760?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;April 24, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was also stated nicely by another person who &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ztuylime/status/1121132899166605312&#34;&gt;replied with this quote&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the beginner&amp;rsquo;s mind there are many possibilities,
but in the expert&amp;rsquo;s there are few
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dailyzen.com/journal/zen-mind-beginners-mind&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shunryu Suzuki&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I know I have a lot to learn in my new role, I&amp;rsquo;ve had an amazing opportunity to ask &amp;ldquo;Why?&amp;rdquo; so many times. I&amp;rsquo;m definitely going to keep wearing this hat for as long as I can as I talk to both coworkers &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/MeganRisdal/status/1127006719492509701?s=20&#34;&gt;as well as users&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/aCraigPfeifer/status/1121089455538999297&#34;&gt;As someone else replied&lt;/a&gt;, by challenging assumptions you&amp;rsquo;re &amp;ldquo;both learning about the environment and moving it forward.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;4-be-vulnerable&#34;&gt;4. Be vulnerable&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People can only help you if they know what you&amp;rsquo;re struggling with or how you want to improve. Maybe it wasn&amp;rsquo;t comfortable for me to tweet the world about not knowing everything, but it got me some amazing replies that can hopefully help even more people than just myself. Plus, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/richwag/status/1120907365157625856&#34;&gt;as someone replied&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;ldquo;If you don&amp;rsquo;t feel uncomfortable you&amp;rsquo;re not learning.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;I dunno, I&amp;#39;ve really struggled to have this kind of vulnerability in my new gig and I think I&amp;#39;ve come off as a know-it-all asshole at times. I think you&amp;#39;re winning üòÅ&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Justin Kiggins (@neuromusic) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/neuromusic/status/1120915698350321664?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;April 24, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This also ties in well with &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/tinkertim/status/1120887904287494145&#34;&gt;some other advice I got&lt;/a&gt; to request feedback early and often as a newcomer to a team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve distilled the advice I got into the several different themes I wrote about above, but at the end of the day my two biggest takeaways are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be patient with yourself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be inquisitive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And eventually you &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; know something again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Product Management as an Episode of Black Mirror</title>
      <link>https://www.meg.dev/posts/product-management-as-an-episode-of-black-mirror/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Apr 2019 01:43:59 -0400</pubDate>
      <author>hello@meg.dev (Meg Risdal)</author>
      <guid>https://www.meg.dev/posts/product-management-as-an-episode-of-black-mirror/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Being a product manager on a small remote, distributed team reminds me a lot of the Black Mirror episode, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Be_Right_Back&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Be Right Back&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this episode of the sci-fi anthology series, a woman uses an AI service to bring back her recently deceased partner. She does so by uploading all of their text messages, emails, voicemails, and any other computer-mediated conversation she shared with him to the, uhh, Cloud I suppose. That&amp;rsquo;s one use case for GDPR data requests! All of this data was then used to train a super language model to embody (literally) a clone of her prematurely departed husband.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what does this have to do with being a product manager on a remote, distributed team? The sheer volume of written text I produce, of course! So much you could nearly hope to train a clone of me someday, language model and all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://source.unsplash.com/eOSqRq2Qm1c/800x450&#34;&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;_Photo by David Clode on Unsplash_&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On remote, distributed teams, asynchronous, high quality communication is essential. Now, I &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; have experience working on remote, distributed teams (so nothing to compare it to), but hopefully this becomes more of the norm. And in any case I think there are a lot of great reasons to write and write a LOT as a product manager. And ideally, you write in a way that faithfully transfers your product thinking, insights, and vision faithfully to Google Docs text and formatting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few reasons why I think Black Mirror worthy documentation should be a best practice regardless of whether you&amp;rsquo;re colocated and shoulder-to-shoulder or if multiple timezones separate you and your closest collaborators:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A no-brainer (maybe literally if this catches on): Clearly written specs should enable my coworkers to focus on building uninterrupted as much as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Propaganda!&amp;rdquo; Framing my artifacts up-front with context which is an opportunity to weave a consistent thread in the story I want to weave for our product&amp;rsquo;s direction. It then becomes a story I can trust my team to internalize.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s like designing a redundant system&amp;hellip; if I make myself partly redundant through documentation, I might be able to afford to spend some of my time on a bit of extra higher level strategy and planning here and there. ;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there you go, that&amp;rsquo;s why being a product manager at a remote, distributed company is like being in an episode of Black Mirror (except in a good way!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reply&#34;&gt;Reply&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow the conversation and discuss on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Amass Engineering Knowledge as a Product Manager</title>
      <link>https://www.meg.dev/posts/amassing-swe-knowledge-as-a-pm/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 19 Feb 2019 23:50:25 -0500</pubDate>
      <author>hello@meg.dev (Meg Risdal)</author>
      <guid>https://www.meg.dev/posts/amassing-swe-knowledge-as-a-pm/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For about the past two years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been a product manager at Kaggle where I work on our public data platform as well as (more recently) our Google Cloud Platform integrations team. Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve had the opportunity to do quite a bit of reflection on my career thanks in part to having a mentee (being a mentor is awesome!). The other day she asked me how I &amp;ldquo;amassed as much engineering knowledge as I have&amp;rdquo;. (She asks great questions!) I shared &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/MeganRisdal/status/1096583566190731264?s=20&#34;&gt;my answer on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and, you know what, I want to blog more so I&amp;rsquo;m sharing it here, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I had to spend a few days thinking about how to respond in a sage, mentor-ly way because it hasn&amp;rsquo;t been something I was necessarily intentional about (my interest in software development is more of a curiosity, probably). At the same time, I definitely had a couple of motivators for accumulating engineering knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Product managers spend their days influencing without authority. Understanding and sympathizing with your engineering coworkers can help with this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apart from the website about goldfish I made when I was 12, I don&amp;rsquo;t already have a background in computer science or software development. I could elaborate on why exactly I include this, but I&amp;rsquo;ll save that for another time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After thinking about her question for a bit and jotting down my thoughts in my favorite note-taking app, Sublime Text, here&amp;rsquo;s what I came up with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-invest-time-to-learn-what-it-takes-to-describe-architecture-and-key-services-at-a-high-level&#34;&gt;1. Invest time to learn what it takes to describe architecture and key services at a high level&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a good idea for two reasons. First, this information should be readily accessible in some form&amp;ndash;take advantage of it! Just ask for the documentation for it or, if necessary, schedule a chat with the owner engineer. Second, this will be one of the highest leverage ways to successfully gauge feasibility of new features. This has saved me a number of times from needing to bother our tech leads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To give an example, when our tech lead was on paternity leave last Northern hemisphere fall, I took over managing our engineering team. Early on, we began experiencing a lot of instability with one of our services. I took the time then to review all of the available architecture and desgin docs (and even a 1hr recorded onboarding video!). From this I was able to draft a design doc proposing specific changes which were ultimately implemented (with a lot of input from my coworkers, of course!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-read-engineering-design-docs-for-fun-especially-requirements-and-alternatives-considered&#34;&gt;2. Read engineering design docs for fun, especially requirements and alternatives considered&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s fun, I promise! This is a lot like #2, but it&amp;rsquo;s more about understanding the process, context, and conversation that happens around engineering designs. Plus understanding what&amp;rsquo;s important and why to your coworkers is a great way to empathize with them. And of course, it can also ensure you&amp;rsquo;re up-to-date on things like database schema changes, new services, etc. that might help you answer questions or inspire product ideas in the future. It&amp;rsquo;s helped me in this way a number of times!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;3-ask-swes-you-work-with-for-more-technical-details-than-you-may-actually-need&#34;&gt;3. Ask SWEs you work with for more technical details than you may actually need&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See, these are all so easy! Even if it&amp;rsquo;s out of pure curiosity that I ask for additional technical details, doing so is a great way to test my knowledge and show my coworkers I care about understanding the problems they&amp;rsquo;re solving. I&amp;rsquo;ve found that my developer coworkers are always more than happy to share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;4-have-and-sometimes-use-a-development-environment-like-your-coworkers&#34;&gt;4. Have (and sometimes use!) a development environment like your coworkers&#39;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing this might be relatively minor and is probably not necessary in all (or maybe most) cases, but it&amp;rsquo;s given me a lot of appreciation for how much our team invests in developer productivity and dev tooling. I like knowing how to make minor changes and deploy them. And my coworkers that helped me out liked seeing me contribute to our codebase and were super happy to help. I set up the server-side C# code that creates the CSVs we use for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/meta-kaggle&#34;&gt;Meta Kaggle&lt;/a&gt;, Kaggle&amp;rsquo;s public dataset about &amp;hellip; Kaggle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so there&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;ve come up with to answer my coworker&amp;rsquo;s question. I&amp;rsquo;m still learning, but these are nonetheless some things that have helped me do my job better (and enjoy it more). The common thread my pieces of advice share, I think, is that they exhibit care for my coworkers, the things they work on, and how they make decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My final piece of meta advice from here is to demonstrate that you&amp;rsquo;re listening and working on improving your engineering knowledge. The more you make product decisions with the things you learned through the help of your coworkers as input, the more people will come to trust you. And in turn, they&amp;rsquo;ll share more with you. It&amp;rsquo;s a really rewarding cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be curious. Be empathetic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reply&#34;&gt;Reply&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow the conversation and discuss on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
