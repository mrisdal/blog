      <description>I’ve worked at Kaggle on-and-off since 2016. In this time, THE most consistent source of user feedback is about the reliability of Kaggle Notebooks. Sessions were slow to start and, far worse, sometimes users would lose hours of work. While progress had been made over the years, we’d never systematically addressed the problems.
Over the past half year or so since I’ve rejoined Kaggle, the Notebooks team renewed its focus on reliability.</description>
