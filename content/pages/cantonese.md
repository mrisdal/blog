## Cantonese podcast

I started an [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/meglearnscanto/) to document my progress learning Cantonese.

## Resources

Apart from using my podcast to force myself to practice every day, here are some resources I'm using to learn Cantonese (sharing in case they are helpful to others):

* Practicing regularly with my partner, a Cantonese speaker.
* Taking courses at the University of Toronto. You can see if there's a course available near you using [this map](https://www.savecantonese.org/map).
* Weekly lessons with a Cantonese tutor. You can find someone on [italki](https://www.italki.com/). [This is the tutor](https://www.learncantonese.co.uk/) I'm working with. It's relatively inexpensive (~$20 or less for one hour).
* Watch TV shows in Cantonese. I'm watching Bluey, a kids' show, for its basic vocabulary. Disney+ has a lot of shows and movies with Cantonese dubs. [A complete list is maintained here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OZgJvAuao3M3GYD7MQ9OWWGPioklMUsGflnWzaxOM8o/edit#gid=0).
* Joining the Cantonese Alliance Discord server. It's super active and they hold weekly chat rooms, weekly beginners' lessons, and host invited talks. It's super well run. The invitation link expires after 7 days, so I'm not linking it here. Ping me if you want an invitation.
* Using the [Drops](https://app.languagedrops.com/) flashcard app for learning vocabulary.
* The Modified Basic Cantonese grammar in Jyutping. [It's available as a PDF here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cantonese/comments/knfytj/best_new_grammar_resource_modified_basic/).
* The [inject Jyutping Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/inject-jyutping/lfgpgjkjglogbndlkikjgbbfoiofbdjp?hl=en).
* The [Cantonese popup dictionary Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cantonese-popup-dictionar/pjnbhojkojmibobcpfgihhnohboldhip?hl=en).
* The [Pleco Chinese dictionary](https://www.pleco.com/). You'll need to download a separate Cantonese dictionary pack.
