Over the past 4ish years, I've worked very closely with developer communities, product teams, and developer relations. In that time, some of the products I've worked on or interfaced with include:

* Kaggle
* Stack Overflow
* Colab
* Socrata
* Schema.org
* Google Cloud Platform
* BigQuery
* Google Datasets Search

Most of my experience has been related to building Kaggle's public datasets platform and integrations with Google Cloud Platform. Recently, I was the lead product manager for Stack Overflow's flagship product (the one everyone knows), Public Q&A. While at Google, I was tightly networked with developer advocates across lots of tools and plaforms.

I have experience on both sides of the fence. As a developer advocate as well as product management where I worked closely with developer advocates, community managers, and other types of community liaisons. 

Recently, I brought this background to Stack Overflow where during my time there in 2019, I introduced some frameworks to more effectively work together with their Community Management team to ensure users' needs were heard and product work was prioritized accordingly.

Why is it important to have frameworks for product and community relations to work together effectively? It's because both want:

1. **Solve the right things**. Limited resources and time mean smart, efficient prioritization is key.
2. **Solved the right way**. This requires high quality information and a user-focused perspective that developer relations brings.

Friction logging is a communication framework used extensively at Google by Developer Advocates who use them to relay feedback to PMs and other product decision-makers. Basically everything I learned was written about by Aja Hammerly here:

### What problem do friction logs solve?

A good product is easy-to-use. But, designing good products is hard and small bugs accumulate easily. This is a problem for DevRel because:

* Bugs get filed into a void
* Developers are annoyed by the backlog
* Nothing rises to a priority where a PM cares
* Less opportunity for holistic, creative solutions

### What is a friction log?

It's an artifact that someone creates to record an end-to-end user experience that highlights all of the little (or big) pain points that make a hypothetical user's goal annoying to accomplish in the product today.

It has the following benefits:

* Empathy for the user experience!
* Bugs are contextualized
* Priority is easier to communicate
* Solutions are left to experts (UXR, UXD, PM, etc.)

To paraphrase Francois Chollet: Good UX makes hard tasks simple. Bad UX makes simple tasks hard. You're far more likely to arrive at a bad UX when you consider the needs of the implementer instead of the needs of the user. And you will arrive at a bad UX if you let users drive the roadmap. This requires research and thoughtfully designed abstraction layers.

### So what does a friction log look like?

I created a really similar template to what I saw used at Google at the time.
