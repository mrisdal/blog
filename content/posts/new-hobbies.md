A couple of weeks ago I tweeted that I wanted to explore new hobbies. For the past couple of years, I've engrossed myself in a job I love. My career development has been really rewarding professionally, but lately I've felt personally underdeveloped. My current hobbies include seeing movies (especially horror and sci-fi) and exploring my new home of Los Angeles (biking, hiking, and of course eating). While these things are fun, I feel like I could be doing and *creating* so much more. 

It seems like everyone I know is into some really awesome hobbies: kite surfing, beekeeping, knitting, curling, trapeze, etc. etc. And I used to do some cool things myself: play oboe, sing in a Georgian folk choir, mountain bike. But lately I've been filling my time with a lot of Netflix.

So I decided to poll my cooler-than-me Twitter audience. What are some interesting hobby ideas I can try out on weekends?

Ideas flooded in! In case you might be inspired to try something new yourself, here are all of the suggestions I received:

* Juggling
* Puzzles
* Voxel Art ([MagicaVoxel](http://www.voxelmade.com/magicavoxel/))
* Kaggle Competitions
* üç∞
* Birdwatching
* Sketching portraits
* Mod podge
* Skateboarding
* Cooking
* Manga/anime sketching
* Start a local food and travel blog
* Meet new people from different cultures
* Ukele
* Tango
* Martial arts
* Drawing painting
* Visit museums
* Coffee/ice cream/chocolate tasting
* Paper crafts
* Baking
* Wine tasting
* Learn to make 3D polyhedra
* Make notebooks
* Help local refugees
* Teach English

Naturally, I ignored ALL of these suggestions. For my first hobby, I'm not straying far from my comfort zone (I am still in my sweats at home, after all)--I'm creating this new personal website. Now, there's a reason why I'm spending my first hobby project this way, of course. With this blog, I'll now have a place for me to document my "new hobby" hobbies.

Anyway, so that's it for the meta-post. I hope you'll look forward to my next!
