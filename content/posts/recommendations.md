It's been almost a year since my last blog post which means it's nearly time for my annual "year-in-review" post. But I want this blog to be more than just my year in review. So before I get to that, I would like to share with you some recommendations. All of them.

Twitter is like a human Chat GPT at scale. I tweet something (a prompt) and magically many, sometimes lots of people start responding to my prompt. Once I asked the entire internet for recommendations. Recommendations about anything. And I got a lot of great stuff in return. The tweet ended up attracting over 500,000 impressions, 358 replies, and 69 quote retweets.

So in this blog post I'll share some favorite replies from this MVT ("most valuable tweet"). Now really couldn't be a better time to celebrate what makes Twitter magic. The people and the ways we can collectively improve one another's lives through sharing.

## Lifehacks

**Sunscreen** was a common recommendation. Like, just wearing any sunscreen. I'd always been okay at wearing sunscreen, but after this I actually ended up making it a real daily habit. So, Twitter changed my life! And has maybe saved my skin? Also up there with sunscreen was **drink more water**.	

{{< tweet user="getwired" id="1420537575316475904" >}}

Using apps to get **free access to books**! Which I guess you could use to check out some of the books people recommended to me in the thread.

{{< tweet user="mai_lin_nguyen" id="1420814723772207109" >}}

Some people smashed together multiple lifehacks into one recommendation like this person who recommends **stretching occasionally** and **splurging on a mattress** (I totally agree). 

{{< tweet user="james_scheibel" id="1420605597179949058" >}}

Other recommendations included [get a bicycle and ride it everywhere](https://twitter.com/balalaikagrunge/status/1420660057860153349), [freezing all of your cheese-powdered snack foods](https://twitter.com/Brophensteen/status/1420920640618467332), [adopt two cats and a hamster](https://twitter.com/hisotalus/status/1420678675410964483), and something about [posts, pylons, and concrete](https://twitter.com/nobletrout/status/1420814062858948616).


## Food

I got a LOT of food recommendations. Some of them oddly specific!

{{< tweet user="allenholub" id="1420523677838233605" >}}

Other food recommendations included:

* [Little ham and Swiss cheese sliders on Hawaiian rolls](https://twitter.com/tjmahr/status/1420561843945414657)
* [Cheese curds at the MN state fair](https://twitter.com/GabeSchenz/status/1420535327983296512)
* [Hatch chile chocolate covered peanut candies](https://twitter.com/shadowbanned_/status/1420527000473665538)
* [Growing and eating your own black cherry tomatoes and ground cherries](https://twitter.com/dwhdai/status/1420757513562120194)
* [Get grilled instead of raw onions at In 'n' Out](https://twitter.com/SnailMamma/status/1420529291129880578)

I found the specificity oddly satisfying. I'd love to do a food-only recommendations thread sometime. It could be a great way to find new recipes or hopefully visually feast upon people's creations. Love to take Instagram pictures of food I make.

## Media

People recommended the following **movies and TV shows**:

* [The 7 Samurais by Akira Kurasawa](https://twitter.com/nstamboglis/status/1420661093819617280?s=20&t=dmV5VhRNPABRCDiNa47D9g)
* [90 Day Fiance](https://twitter.com/ChloeCondon/status/1420526132835753986)
* [Killing Eve](https://twitter.com/databoydg/status/1420783839404695554)
* [Atypical](https://twitter.com/ModernNadeshiko/status/1421409595142987781)
* [The short film Light is Calling](https://twitter.com/TartanLlama/status/1420786701174202381)

And here's one I waited too long to try out ... Bluey! I just got a Disney+ subscription so I can watch with Cantonese dubs.

{{< tweet user="kornys" id="1420780398896877568" >}}

Some **books**, too:

* [John Dies at the End](https://twitter.com/davidasboth/status/1420669458415292417)
* [All the books by Ilona Andrews](https://twitter.com/JennaJrdn/status/1420557443692732417)

* [The Wee Free Men by Terry Pratchett](https://twitter.com/DrKashik/status/1420540509655867395) (or as another user replied, "everything by Terry Pratchett")

## Products

A lot of people recommended [this vacuum](https://www.dyson.com/vacuum-cleaners/cordless/v11/shop-all). Weirdly I ended up buying a similar one a few months later when I moved to Canada. My partner is allergic to my cat so we vacuum multiple times per day. 

{{< tweet user="ChelseaParlett" id="1420563652613087236" >}}

Also, I still want [this fan](https://www.meaco.com/products/meacofan-1056-air-circulator). Love a good fan!

{{< tweet user="SimonAHPInfo" id="1420741192275304452" >}}

Here are some more products people recommended (I promise no affiliate links):

* [Buy a dehumidifier](https://twitter.com/Nyarlathocon/status/1420949206974582789) (did they mean humidifier?)
* [Garmin 935 running watch](https://twitter.com/tmllr/status/1420568786705338368)
* [Bitwarden password manager](https://twitter.com/abaranov/status/1420527967717912577)
* [Hybrid LED project light tool](https://twitter.com/adamlaiacano/status/1420531338801782785)

## Hobbies

If you're looking for something new to do, there's a lot of good ideas shared. For example, someone recommended **tying knots**. I assume as a hobby? I'm not sure!

{{< tweet user="abiylfoyp" id="1420568444362051587" >}}

Some other hobbies people recommended or gave me tips about:

* [Mountain biking or trail running](https://twitter.com/eamcvey/status/1420558601878392833)
* [Cross-stitch](https://twitter.com/wholemilk/status/1420793507690684416)
* [Scalloping](https://twitter.com/ErinWestgate/status/1421019853054529539)
* [Beekeeping](https://twitter.com/rootpoint/status/1420757714402103316)

## Will our AI overlords replace us?

So of course we have to end here. This is what Chat GPT had to say in response to my "recommendations" prompt:

> Sure! Here are a few recommendations:
> 1. If you're looking for a good book to read, I recommend "The Alchemist" by Paulo Coelho. It's a beautifully written novel about a shepherd boy who embarks on a journey to find his personal legend.
> 2. If you're in the mood for a movie, I recommend "The Shawshank Redemption." It's a classic drama about hope, friendship, and the human spirit.
> 3. If you enjoy listening to music, I recommend checking out the album "To Pimp a Butterfly" by Kendrick Lamar. It's a groundbreaking work of hip hop that tackles themes of race, identity, and social justice.
> 4. If you're interested in trying out a new recipe, I recommend making a stir-fry. It's a quick and easy dish that you can customize with your favorite vegetables and proteins.
> 5. If you're in need of some self-care, I recommend taking a relaxing bath with Epsom salt and essential oils. Epsom salt can help soothe muscle aches and improve circulation, while essential oils can help you relax and unwind.
>
> I hope these recommendations are helpful! Let me know if you have any specific interests or needs, and I can provide more tailored recommendations.

Seems like not a terrible way to spend the rest of my holiday break sick with COVID. But it lacks heart and experience. I'll continue to trust the wisdom of the human crowd (even though many people replied to this thread telling me not to trust people on the internet ...). Anyway, who (or what) will you trust? [Check out the tweet](https://twitter.com/MeganRisdal/status/1420521459982606336) for all of the recommendations.
